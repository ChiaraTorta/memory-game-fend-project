## Instructions

The goal of the game is to uncover all cards. Two cards remain uncover if they have the same symbol. 
The timer starts when the first card is turned. 
The stars indicate the player's performance. 3 stars indicates the highest performance and 0 stars the lowest.

- **up to 13 moves**: 3 stars
- **14-19 moves**: 2 stars
- **20-25 moves**: 1 star
- **from 26 moves**: the player loses all the stars

If you press the relaunch button the game will be reset (and the cards shuffled) and you can start a new game.

If you discover all the pairs of cards you will see a dialogue with your score, the number of moves and the time you took to win.

## Description

This project is part of the Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program.

The [starter project](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. 
I needed to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. In order to do that I had to modify the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

###Have fun training your visual memory!###
